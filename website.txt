In my first year of high school I learned what a Ouija board was, how to use it. It was Thai temple camp. Late at night. 
The younger girls were asleep in bed. Just girls, all ages, all Thai, sleeping in the renovated garage behind the main temple. 
It was a two room structure, one room stacked upon the other. We were upstairs. The ceiling was sloped, like the roof above. 
That week we huddled around a quickly-made ouija board. It was a piece of paper with every digit and letter of the alphabet written out in rows, 
enclosed by the words yes, no, and goodbye.
